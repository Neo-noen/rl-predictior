# rl-predictior
Reinforcement Learning inspired model.

*Note: This model was only created for the purpose of learning and entertainment, it is nowhere close to a real reinforcement learning algorithm or model.*
This model was made in a few hours, and can predict a range of number after another integer fairly well.

Use this for shits and giggles.
